# Refactor-SEO
# Project Description
This project was for me to refactor the Horiseon website to not only fix the jump llink for 'Search Engine Optimization' but also remove and redundant code in the CSS file. I want to leave this code a little bit cleaner than when I found it. 

## User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria 
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
